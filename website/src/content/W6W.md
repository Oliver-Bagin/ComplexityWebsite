## Questions

#### Reflection Question: How has your perception of ignorance changed? How can your renewed perspectives allow you to design-think a solution to a problem you/your community are facing?

## Response
Across these reflections a common theme for me has been letting go of my Ego. It is clear to me ignorance can often stem from our Egos. It’s almost like we put ourselves under a vail to save us from embarrassment. This week’s facilitation had a great quote “Acknowledging that we do not understand information opens the door to creativity and empathy”. Accepting ignorance is important and shouldn’t be embarrassing, it should be power to us. As we learn more, we realize we know less. This shouldn’t be a good or bad thing it should just be a fact. 

Once we acknowledge this ignorance, we can start to use design thinking. What a great tool. Design thinking simply must be one of the most applicable methods in my complexity tool kit. It is almost always a useful and good place to start. I cannot find the real quote but isn’t it the ‘holy grail of innovation’? Like everything useful it seems design thinking is an agile way of deepening understanding. To really use it thought we must relinquish as much of ‘what we think we know’ and prepare to accept new ideas and information.

Next time I try to make something for someone else I will certainly try design think it. My key take away will be to try remove my preexisting thoughts and prejudice and to empathies with the person I am designing for. Then in an agile way keep coming back to this part of the process growing my mental model of the situation.

### Ideas
Hierarchy of complexity tools. Helps people work out what is and isn’t an appropriate tool for use depending on what type of complex problem they are facing.

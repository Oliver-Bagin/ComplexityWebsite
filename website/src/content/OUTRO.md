## Questions

#### What did I learn?
#### How did I grow?

## Response
I haven’t learnt much. I only know a few more definitions that I could write down and only know a couple new facts from the facilitations. So why am I so content? Because I have grown. 

I know I have grown because saying I have spent hours engaging with this class to only emerge with a few new facts and that doesn’t upset me. Prior to this class it would have. That’s because this class was not about ‘facts’. It was about a type of learning I can’t quantify but that was more useful than I ever could have expected.

I feel like my perspective now is so different from when I started this subject. I mean for a start I’m not a reductionist any more; I love non linear processes and I feel like complexity and not understanding it is exciting. This is so different to how I felt coming into these facilitations.

I feel like a more adept learner than ever. I’m ready to get in the deep end, not understanding anything, and start tugging at some strings. I have some new intuitions, some mental models and that’s all I need.

Thanks,
Oliver Bagin

## Questions

#### Discuss how learning about complex adaptive systems and the informational cascade model shaped the way you analysed problems in class. Alternatively, provide limitations of the frameworks, and propose different approaches. 


## Response
Information cascades feel like ‘the power of the sun’ who ever has it in ‘the palm of [their] hand’ would surely be a god among men. Cascades and virality seem to be intertwined in the 21st century. I recently met a man who claimed to have started the ‘I’m a jedi census’ movement at the turn of the century as he was exploring ‘virality’ (before the term had even been coined) as part of some research on cascades. More than 70,000 people elected Jedi as their religion.

I think that I could apply CAS and Information Cascades to cause widespread influence in a system. I think that there is ethical consideration of whether or not this influence is undue or not.

### Ideas
Create a tool to help stop information cascades. Or alternative a tool to help start them. Understanding virality who provide for amazing research.

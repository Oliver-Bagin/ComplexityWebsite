## Questions

#### Can you think of a complex issue that has lacked cultural competence in how it has been addressed so far? How could cultural competence and co-design processes improve progress in that space?

## Response
Firstly, Co-Design is such a great idea its now an important tool in my complexity tool kit. Comparatively to consultation, Co-Design is a much more useful tool when things are complex. We all know that diverse teams are important but Co-Design really highlights why. It also shows us we can and should encourages non team members inclusion beyond the discussion phase and in the design phase when we don’t have the diversity we might need. 

An example of an issue that has lacked cultural competence is Bush Fires. Aboriginal People have traditional ways of responding to natural disasters, yet we see very little of their knowledge being applied. It is clear we lack the Cultural Competence to engage this knowledge - further highlighted by the Sand Talks reading earlier this semester. If we applied Co-design and stopped trying to 'consult' indigenous groups and tried to work constructively together it might be a different story. The problem comes form us trying to fit their knowledge into a western framework, Co-Design could lead us to a non-western or hybrid framework. 

I have worked in monotone groups before – there are a lot of people like me out there. It feels nice to have everyone understand my context, but it has caused us problems. Lacking cultural competence in a business world is unfortunate. If I want to engage the world, I will need to be culturally knowledgeable – this means more than anything knowing enough to know when (or at least be suspicious that) I lack the cultural knowledge to engage with something.

### Ideas
Tool which helps people understand when they need more cultural knowledge. What would that look like? I have no idea…

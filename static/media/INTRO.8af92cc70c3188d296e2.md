#### Preface
The following text constitutes my weekly reflections on the material covered in our classes. Each week questions were posed to guid reflection. The questions were also considered within the context of my final artifact however. I tried to considered what the tutorials meant for the real world and about complexity models. I tried to think about their applications in business, my own personal life and in decision making. I also endeavoured to think about new models or improvements to current systems. I think these reflections have helped me be well poised to tackle my final artifact. 

Using Kolb’s model, I consider the workshops to be 'concrete learning' and thus want these refection’s to constitute my ‘elective observation’ and ‘abstract conceptualization’ phases. This leaves room for my final artifact to be the ‘active experimentation’ phase. I have added 'ideas' sections to some of the reflections that hight light how I might experiment with the content.

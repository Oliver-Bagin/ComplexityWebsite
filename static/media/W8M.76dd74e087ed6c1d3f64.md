## Questions

#### How do you approach your own ignorance and uncertainty, and could you see yourself having conspiracy beliefs? What risks do you take when you are presented with new information? Does this lead to you drawing your own conclusions?


## Response
This topic was interesting to me because it goes against what I have found to be my overarching theme for my reflections which is to be ‘more accepting of new information’. This facilitation clearly shows why we need to be defensive of what we accept and what we do not accept. A pattern that seemed to be obvious in conspiratorial groups was their rejection of other people’s information. So, it’s clear that accepting or rejecting both too little and or too much information can lead to conspiratorial thinking. 

I doubt I would have conspiracy beliefs but after this session it’s hard to know. I just got shivers down my spine thinking about how we don’t know if all we see about China is propaganda, maybe we aren’t the informed they are. But Dr Klein’s method of considering how many people would have to keep quite makes me feel better.

Dr Klein’s work was interesting. His work is complex, its interdisciplinary and researching such an interconnected problem. I wonder if he has taken an experimental approach and attempted to start a conspiracy theory. Maybe that is unethical. 

### Ideas
Firstly, try get in contact with Dr Klein about doing a research project with him. Secondly, maybe for my project I could look at creating a model for detecting conspiracy.

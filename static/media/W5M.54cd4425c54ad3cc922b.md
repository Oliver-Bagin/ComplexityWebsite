## Questions

#### 1) Through a transdisciplinary approach, how does it help in addressing wicked problems? Is there any practical approach(s) in tackling wicked problems? 2) Have you had any experience dealing/working in wicked problems? How have you overcome those issues? Are there any challenges and limitations? What have you learnt from that experience?**


## Response

This week was

I think that considering that there is a lot of literature out there that can help facility solving wicked problem it would be egregiously beneficial to be able to clearly and easily recognize them. I'm thinking of three things, definitions, mental models and maybe I'll try something trivial too.

The taxonomy of Complexity here in interesting. I like to imagine that Wicked problems might be to Complex Problems what NP-Complete problems are to NP problems. That is Wicked problems are the hardest subset of the complex problem space. But I'll endeavor to be less of a prescriptivist and more of a descriptivist. I want to become more open and interdisciplinary as is so clearly necessary from this week’s facilitation. 

So, disregarding my initial taxonomy, what might be a way I could recognize wicked problems that appreciates the space wholistically. A good place to start is probably the following: loose problem boundaries, interconnectedness, incompleteness, the butterfly effect, uniqueness as well as contrasts between stakeholders, positions and systems - that is paradoxical nature. This gives us a kind of mesh definition. Is that a thing? A five second search says no so I’m going to coin that as a neologism. Wicked problems are probably partially all these things and at least some of them. 

I might want to explore this idea of a mesh definition or maybe even a visual definition in more detail. This could be a great way of generating mental models.

I think that choosing share house groups – from a social perspective - might be the simplest wicked problem I have encountered. Quantification of solutions is hard. Optimizing one aspect will almost always cause problems somewhere else and there are always unknowable effects to actions. People’s true feelings are always obfuscated partially even to them self. Optimizing the division of the group for one person will always hurt someone else and people have such different requirements. Interestingly 

### Ideas
Mesh definitions, defining loosely and abstractly. Tool for making inferences without strict definitions.
